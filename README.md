# gilded-rose
Clojure implementation of the gilded rose kata, illustrating how simple the problem can be when you're not wasting time trying to figure out how to use design patterns, class wrappers, etc. as required in the original C# code.  

See https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata for a collection of implementations across different languages.  Most do not implement a test suite as that is part of the exercise, this repo includes the tests I felt necessary to cover all the cases.
